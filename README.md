# MeshTool
This tool will be used for generating meshes in editor along splines.
Furture work will include combining spline meshes with other types of generated meshes.

## Progress
So far I have setup the custom inspector to generate a spline. This should allow for extending a spline as far as we want.
I have also setup a utility which holds methods for finding points, tangents, and normals 2D/3D.
Class which ensures each mesh and material is unique so old materials and meshes are not affected when generating new meshes.
Added ability to edit and generate any mesh shape we want
Can save meshes now
