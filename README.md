# MeshTool


## Progress
So far I have setup the custom inspector to generate a spline. This should allow for extending a spline as far as we want.
I have also setup a utility which holds methods for finding points, tangents, and normals 2D/3D.
Class which ensures each mesh and material is unique so old materials and meshes are not affected when generating new meshes.

## TODO
- [ ] Add basic cube mesh generation
- [ ] Add ability to edit and generate any mesh shape we want
